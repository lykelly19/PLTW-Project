Revisions made so far: 
- Added Chrome dino sprite and resized it to fit the canvas

Potential Future Changes: 
- change the dinosaur color? 
- make the blocks occur less frequently
- change the blocks into some other sprite (ex. trees)
- organize the repository by adding src and img folders (might need to change path of chrome_dino.png in index.js if so)
